1. why choosing i3 7100?
    it has two cores and four threads. what I am planing to do is simply one GPU machine learning / deep learning tasks. this CPU is enough for that.
2. why choosing GPU GTX 1080 Ti?
    it has 11Toperations/second capability. it also has 11GB high speed high bandwidth memory. this could be a budget choice if not using titan x or titan xp.
3. why choosing H270 motherboard?
    it is compatible with i3 7100 without doing bios update, I am not a fan of doing bios updates. also this provides enough pcie lanes (20 lanes in total), which is enough for GPU x16 connection. also, no plan to do CPU overclock.
4. why using GPU watercooling?
    it is for a). fix the loud noise issue of the FE GPU fan, b). lower temperature means better performance, always.
5. why using 2*8GB = 16GB memory?
    16GB memory should be sufficient for 11GB of GPU. 2*8GB will take advantage of H270 capability.
6. why choosing power = 650w?
    the system will take 450w power at peak. if considering some unusual power comsumption, 650w should be enough.
7. why choosing 2 stroages?
    SSD provides speed, HDD provides actual data storage.
